Cracking the Culinary Code
==============================
Using Yelp Reviews to Guide Foodies towards their Perfect Plate
DSEI210-S23-Final-Project

We present extensive analysis of the Yelp Dataset and create two recommender systems: content based and collaborative filtering. 
All our data analysis, cleaning, and model building can be found in the notebooks folder.
